Reduce A into reduced row echelon form with partial pivoting and Gauss-Jordan method.

Input matrix A (5 x 4):
[[     0.       0.       0.       0. ]
 [     0.       0.       0.       2.3]
 [     0.       9.      12.       2. ]
 [     0.       0.       0.     -10. ]
 [     0.       0.      32.  231225. ]]

Reduced row echelon form R (5 x 4):
[[0. 1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 1.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0.]]
