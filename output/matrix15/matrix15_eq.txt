Solve Ax=b, given the augmented matrix C=[A|b].

Input (augmented) matrix C (3 x 4):
[[0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1. 0.]]

ps (one particular solution to Ax=b):
[[0.]
 [0.]
 [0.]]

gs_list (2 general solutions to Ax=0):

0-th gs (index from 0):
[[-1.]
 [ 0.]
 [ 0.]]

1-th gs (index from 0):
[[ 0.]
 [-1.]
 [ 0.]]

The general solution form: s = ps + \sum(k_i * gs_i), where k_i are free variables.
