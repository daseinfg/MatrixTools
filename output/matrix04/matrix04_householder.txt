Householder Reduction, s.t. A=QR, where R is the reduced matrix.

Input matrix A (2 x 6):
[[ 0.   1.6  0.  32.   0.   0. ]
 [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0. ]]

Q (2 x 2) (Orthonormal):
[[1. 0.]
 [0. 1.]]

R (2 x 6) (Reduced matrix):
[[ 0.   1.6  0.  32.   0.   0. ]
 [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0. ]]

(Check) Product of QR (2 x 6):
[[ 0.   1.6  0.  32.   0.   0. ]
 [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0. ]]
