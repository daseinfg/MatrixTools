QR decomposition with Gram-Schmidt algorithm, s.t. A=QR.

Input matrix A (2 x 6):
[[ 0.   1.6  0.  32.   0.   0. ]
 [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0. ]]

Q (2 x 6):
[[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]

R (6 x 6):
[[ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0. ]
 [ 0.   1.6  0.  32.   0.   0. ]
 [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0. ]
 [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0. ]
 [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0. ]
 [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0. ]]

(Check) Product of QR (2 x 6):
[[ 0.   1.6  0.  32.   0.   0. ]
 [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0. ]]
